> Computational photography refers to digital image capture and processing techniques that use digital computation instead of optical processes. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_photography)

That is a neat definition, but what does it actually mean?

> If we take a picture on instagram and apply a filter on it, is that computational photography?

> What if we digitally enhance our photographs after we take them?

> What about memes?

Before understanding what computational photography means let us remember what do we mean by photography?

### A primer on Photography

In simple terms we have a device which creates images by recording light reflected from real world objects on a sensor.

This means a camera essentially records light. Every little detail in a camera is to optimize that goal perfectly.

So if we *zoom* out a little and see the big picture, there are three main components to photography.

1. How much light is entering the device (The aperture)
2. How long we are allowing the light to enter (The shutter speed)
3. How sensitive is the sensor to the light (ISO)

If you are already familiar with these terms, and have some experience in creating images with various combinations of these parameters feel free to skip to the next version.

And now if you are still here, let us get started with the basic components of a camera.

#### Aperture

First we talk about Aperture. Now before we go all technical I want you to imagine something for me.

For a second, imagine that you are leaving a movie theatre. As you walk out, you are suddenly blinded by a flash of white light. You squeeze your eyes shut. It takes a couple of seconds for your eyes to readjust themselves to the brightness, and you slowly open them up again.

Sounds familiar?

This is exactly what **aperture** means.

It is the measure of how much the lens is opened. It is usually measured in f-stops and expressed in numbers such as 1.4,1.8,2,2.8,5.6,8,11,16.

Something to remember here is that the lower the number is the bigger the opening of the lens. The higher the f-stop is the smaller the opening of the lens.

> But what effect does this have on the image?

Well if you have a bigger opening you have more light or more information coming through. So a smaller aperture or larger f-stop would lead to darker pictures and vice-versa.

> That's great, what else can we do using aperture?

- The Aperture also controls Depth-Of-Field.

> What is Depth-Of-Field?

Depth-of-Field is simply the distance between the nearest and the farthest object in the camera's viewing field which are in acceptable focus.

By acceptable focus we mean that we can make out the details of the object.
