So you have been going through mathematical models and equations for all sorts of things and everywhere you go you see this equation.

Obviously you know why it's used. It is the infamous exponential decay function. But you want to know why specifically this function. What is so special about an exponent that it is used to model decay.
$$e^{-x}$$

In this blog we will learn the following:

* What is a decay function?
* Why use exponentials?
* How does it help us model systems?

Let's get started with the topic straight away.

### What is a decay function
