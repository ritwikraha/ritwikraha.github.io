I'm a Machine Learning Engineer previously at PyImageSearch (2022-2024) and a Google Developer Expert in Machine Learning, based in Kolkata, India. My passion lies in bridging the gap between cutting-edge research and practical applications, specializing in Computer Vision, Deep Learning, and Causal Inference. At PyImageSearch, I've consulted for 8+ clients, translating their challenges into effective ML solutions, deploying models ranging from CNNs and RNNs to Transformers for both CV and NLP tasks. I've also designed and implemented 5+ end-to-end courses on advanced topics like NeRFs, Transformers, JAX, and Causal Analysis, and contribute regularly to research-oriented content. Prior to PyImageSearch, I developed and deployed a production-ready ML model at Tata Consultancy Services (Feb 2021 - Feb 2022) that improved trailer fill rate by 28% with a <3% error margin. I regularly share my expertise through talks and tutorials as a Machine Learning Research Advocate. 


I'm also a visual designer and storyteller ([portfolio](https://www.ritwikraha.com/)) and enjoy books and movies in my free time.
