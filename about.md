I am a machine learning and computer vision enthusiast currently working on research projects involving causality of emotion induced EEG signals. My areas of interest include computer vsion, machine learning and causal inference.

I am also a committed visual designer, passionate about UX and UI, with a keen eye for design languages. My designs and blogs related to it can be found [here.](https://www.ritwikraha.com/)

When I am not studying or working, I live an alternate life as a bibliophile and a movie buff.
