The following is a table of some data points.\n\n| x  | y  |\n|----|----|\n| 10 | 10 |\n| 20 | 20 |\n| 30 | 40 |\n| 40 | 80 |\n\nNow as we plot this data we can see that it doubles with every iteration, compounding at a constant rate. This rate of compounding is described by $$e^x$$.\n\nSo we can go as far as to say that exponential is the natural language of growth. Now, what happens when we use this same idea but reverse it. \n\nAgain, let us look at a table of data.\n\n| x  | y    |\n|----|------|\n| 10 | 10   |\n| 20 | 5    |\n| 30 | 2.5  |\n| 40 | 1.25 |\n\nThe graph for this data would be something like this:\n\n![decreasing](/assets/images/5post/exponential-decay.gif)\n\nThis can be modeled by the equation $$y= e^{-x}$$\n\nBut why? Why does this equation fit this data so well? To understand this better let us go back to our old friend - **rate-of-change**.\n\nNow how do we describe decay through calculus? Well, we need to take a quantity $$N$$ and another quantity $$x$$. And we need to write how the rate of change of $$N$$ varies with the rate of change of $$x$$.\n\n$$\\frac{dN}{dx}$$\n\nWe can say that this rate of change may be something as simple as $$-bN$$ where $$b$$ is a constant.\n\n$$\\frac{dN}{dx} = -bN \\\\\n$$\n\nThis equation can be rewritten and solved fairly simply\n\n$$\\frac{dN}{N} = -bx \\\\ \nln(N) = -bx+C$$\n\nSolving for the logarithm and ignoring the constant of integration we have\n\n$$N(x) = N_oe^{-bx}$$\n\nWhere $$N(x)$$ is the current value of $$N$$ with respect to $$x$$ and $$N_0$$ is the initial value or the starting point of $$N$$\n\n### How does it help us model systems?\n\nNow we know that the function $$A(x) = A_0e^{-bx}$$ can very easily model the process of compounding decay. \n\nThe use of this equation in modeling real-world applications is numerous.\n\n- It is particularly useful in modelling a certain kind of decay\n- It is easy to determine when the decaying quantity would be half of its original amount. This is commonly known as half-tim.\n- The function is also easily differentiable with it's rate of change being the same as the function itself.\n\nThe function $$y= e^{-x}$$ is a powerful tool to have in your arsenal. But it is even more powerful when we understand when and where to use it best. Not all systems that decay gradually can be modelled using the **exponential decay function**, the trick is to use it selectively and use it best. \n\n### References\n\n- [https://www.thoughtco.com/exponential-decay-definition-2312215#:~:text=In mathematics%2C exponential decay describes,of time that has passed](https://www.thoughtco.com/exponential-decay-definition-2312215#:~:text=In%20mathematics%2C%20exponential%20decay%20describes,of%20time%20that%20has%20passed).\n- [https://courses.lumenlearning.com/waymakercollegealgebra/chapter/exponential-growth-and-decay/](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/waymakercollegealgebra/chapter/exponential-growth-and-decay/)\n- [https://mathworld.wolfram.com/DecreasingFunction.html](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/DecreasingFunction.html) ","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\nSo you have been going through mathematical models and equations for all sorts of things and everywhere you go you see this equation.\n\nObviously, you know why it's used.
